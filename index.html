        <p>Down the street you can hear her scream "you're a disgrace"</p>
        <p>As she slams the door in his drunken face,</p>
        <p>And now he stands outside</p>
        <p>And all the neighbors start to gossip and drool</p>
        <p>He cries "Oh girl, you must be mad,</p>
        <p>What happened to the sweet love you and me had?"</p>
        <p>Against the door he leans and starts a scene,</p>
        <p>And his tears fall and burn the garden green</p>
        <p>And so castles made of sand,</p>
        <p>Fall in the sea, eventually</p>
        <p>A little Indian brave who before he was ten,</p>
        <p>Played war games in the woods with his Indian friends,</p>
        <p>And he built a dream that when he grew up,</p>
        <p>He would be a fearless warrior Indian Chief</p>
        <p>Many moons passed and more the dream grew stronger,</p>
        <p>Until tomorrow, he would sing his first war song,</p>
        <p>And fight his first battle, but something went wrong,</p>
        <p>Surprise attack killed him in his sleep that night
        <p>And so castles made of sand,</p>
        <p>Melts into the sea, eventually</p>
        <p>There was a young girl, whose heart was a frown,</p>
        <p>'Cause she was crippled for life, and she couldn't speak a sound</p>
        <p>And she wished and prayed she could stop living,</p>
        <p>So she decided to die</p>
        <p>She drew her wheel chair to the edge of the shore,</p>
        <p>and to her legs she smiled</p>
        <p>"You won't hurt me no more"</p>
        <p>But then a sight she'd never seen made her jump and say</p>
        <p>"Look, a golden winged ship is passing my way"</p>
        <p>And it really didn't have to stop, it just kept on going</p>
        <p>And so castles made of sand</p>
        <p>Slips into the sea, eventually</p>
